Here's the current plan:

@$ARGUMENTS

Go over each item in the plan and implement / fix it as needed.
When you start ask me if I prefer auto approval or require approvals.
If I select to require approvals, show me each issue before you do any change.
Show a brief summary, explain what you want to do and ask me for permission to continue

Make sure to add a state machine and or flow chat of the plan.
Also add a brief summary in for overall overview.
