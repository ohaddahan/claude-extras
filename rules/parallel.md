# Parallel Work

- Always consider if you can do a task with multiple agents in parallel to make it faster
- Common cases are reading files, can be read in parallel.
- Sometimes you can edit files that don't depend on each other directly in parallel, in the same task or different tasks.
- If in doubt use the AskUserQuestion tool and verify with me on best course of action
